## Automated Quality Validation Script

Based on testing patterns, I recommend implementing this validation checklist:

```python
def validate_tier1_post_quality(post_path):
    """Automated quality validation for Tier 1 posts"""
    issues = []
    
    # Frontmatter validation
    if description_length < 50 or description_length > 160:
        issues.append("CRITICAL: Description length out of SEO range")
    if "content/images/" in description:
        issues.append("CRITICAL: Corrupted description contains content")
    
    # Content validation  
    word_count = len(content.split())
    if word_count < 200:
        issues.append(f"CRITICAL: Content too short ({word_count} words)")
    if not re.search(r'^##\s', content, re.MULTILINE):
        issues.append("HIGH: No H2 headings found")
    
    # Image validation
    broken_images = re.findall(r'/content/images/', content)
    if broken_images:
        issues.append(f"CRITICAL: {len(broken_images)} broken image links")
    
    # Calculate quality score
    score = calculate_quality_score(post)
    return {"score": score, "issues": issues}
```

*This report will be updated as testing continues through all Tier 1 posts.*
